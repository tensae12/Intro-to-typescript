- installation of axios as npm module for network requests 

steps
    npm install -g typescript ts-node (add sudo if permission denied error)
    npm init -y (to generate the package.json file where we record dependencies)
    npm install axios (npm module for network requests)

    npm install @types/node --save--dev

    npm install @types/node --save-dev is used to install TypeScript declaration files for Node.js. 
    These declaration files, denoted by @types/node, provide type definitions for the Node.js runtime environment, 
    allowing you to write TypeScript code with proper type checking and editor support 

    


The tsconfig.json file is the configuration file used for TypeScript projects. It allows you to specify various compiler options 
and settings for your TypeScript code. To configure the ECMAScript target version in tsconfig.json, you can use the "target" option
    
to get started create the index.ts, 
tsc index.ts - compile the .ts file(we will get the compiler version of our typescript code in index.js)
node index.js to execute
ts-node index.ts -- to compile and execute in on command 



                    *** Type Annotation and Inference ***

            Type Annotation - tells TypeScript what type the value has
            Type Inference - is the system that TypeScript uses to guess what the type is 
            'Any' type is type like others, typescript can n ot do any error checkong around varioables with 'Any' type.

            *** Type Annotation and Inference functions & objects ***
            type inference only works around the return value from a function --> so typescript is going to figure out what value
            or what type of value we return in from a function
